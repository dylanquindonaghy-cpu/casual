# Overnight build log

Written by the unattended `/overnight` loop (see `.claude/commands/overnight.md`). One entry per
task, newest at the bottom. Every decision that would normally wait for Dylan's OK is recorded
here with its reason, so it can be confirmed or reversed in the morning.

Standing instructions (Dylan, 2026-09-27): full autonomy on schema/auth/tenancy/messaging/rules
decisions (still reviewed by `guardrails-reviewer` and audited by `claims-auditor`); Gates A and B
don't stop the build; commit and push per task on `build/overnight`.

## 2026-09-27: Phase 1 closed (before the loop started)

- Task: "Tests: `rls.every-table`, `tenancy.isolation`, expired/used links rejected, events written"
- Added after the guardrails review: office link expiry (1 ms before and exactly at 15 min),
  reuse and disabled-user tests; 10-way races for office and worker login, each with a
  read-then-write control; a full-row event contract for every `auth.*` action and all 7 rate
  limits (`tests/integration/auth.events.test.ts`); tests for `recordEvent`'s personal-data guard
  (`tests/integration/events.record.test.ts`); effective-privilege, PUBLIC-grant, view, function
  and sequence checks in `rls.every-table`; tests now pick their events by event id, not by
  clock; test runs and e2e runs take an advisory lock so two runs can't drop each other's
  database.
- verify.sh: `VERIFIED tree=7c0303e01c7dc68b e2e=true` (31 files, 595 tests)
- claims-auditor: `VERDICT: DONE`
- Commit: `cef6425 Phase 1: tenancy, data model, login` on `build/overnight`
- Push: **failed**, WSL git has no GitHub credentials (`could not read Username`). The commit is
  local only until Dylan sets up credentials and pushes.
- Decision: after 3 failed audit rounds on a task, the loop stops (golden rule 13) rather than
  skipping to the next task. Tasks it can't finish without a real outside service are recorded
  as blocked and skipped, not stopped on.
