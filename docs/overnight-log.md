# Overnight build log

Written by the unattended `/overnight` loop (see `.claude/commands/overnight.md`). One entry per
task, newest at the bottom. Every decision that would normally wait for Dylan's OK is recorded
here with its reason, so it can be confirmed or reversed in the morning.

Standing instructions (Dylan, 2026-09-27): full autonomy on schema/auth/tenancy/messaging/rules
decisions (still reviewed by `guardrails-reviewer` and audited by `claims-auditor`); Gates A and B
don't stop the build; commit and push per task on `build/overnight`.

## 2026-09-27: Phase 1 closed (before the loop started)

- Task: "Tests: `rls.every-table`, `tenancy.isolation`, expired/used links rejected, events written"
- Added after the guardrails review: office link expiry (1 ms before and exactly at 15 min),
  reuse and disabled-user tests; 10-way races for office and worker login, each with a
  read-then-write control; a full-row event contract for every `auth.*` action and all 7 rate
  limits (`tests/integration/auth.events.test.ts`); tests for `recordEvent`'s personal-data guard
  (`tests/integration/events.record.test.ts`); effective-privilege, PUBLIC-grant, view, function
  and sequence checks in `rls.every-table`; tests now pick their events by event id, not by
  clock; test runs and e2e runs take an advisory lock so two runs can't drop each other's
  database.
- verify.sh: `VERIFIED tree=7c0303e01c7dc68b e2e=true` (31 files, 595 tests)
- claims-auditor: `VERDICT: DONE`
- Commit: `cef6425 Phase 1: tenancy, data model, login` on `build/overnight`
- Push: first attempt **failed** (`could not read Username`): git's credential helper path had an
  unescaped space in "Program Files". Fixed on 2026-09-28 (the helper path is now escaped) and
  `build/overnight` pushed to GitHub. Pushes from WSL now work through the Windows credential
  manager.
- Hours: Phase 1 took 4.5 h (0.6 h proposal, 3.9 h build); logged in `PLAN.md` with the in-depth
  note in `docs/work-log.md`. From now on each task logs its own hours the same way.
- Decision: after 3 failed audit rounds on a task, the loop stops (golden rule 13) rather than
  skipping to the next task. Tasks it can't finish without a real outside service are recorded
  as blocked and skipped, not stopped on.

## 2026-09-28 16:37 UTC: Phase 2, "Schema: shifts, assignments, requests, offers, credential_rules (per sector/role)"

**Plan.** New `src/lib/db/schema/roster.ts` with the five tables, exported from the schema index;
`npm run db:generate` writes migration `0004`; `TABLE_ACCESS` entries; isolation fixtures for each
table and each new composite foreign key (`tests/helpers/tenant-rows.ts`), so `rls.every-table`,
`tenancy.isolation` and `rls.mutation` cover the new tables automatically; a new
`tests/integration/roster.schema.test.ts` for the constraints, run as the app role; docs
(`docs/data-model.md`) updated to match what is built.

**Decisions (would normally wait for Dylan's OK):**

| Decision | Why | Alternative considered |
|---|---|---|
| Every link between the new tables is a composite `(firm_id, x_id)` foreign key (shift→site, assignment→shift/worker, request→worker/shift/office user, offer→shift/worker) | Postgres checks foreign keys without RLS, so a plain key would let Firm A point at Firm B's rows (CLAUDE.md convention) | Plain keys as in the old DDL sketch: unsafe |
| The app may SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE `shifts`, `assignments`, `requests` and `offers`, but not DELETE them | These rows are the evidence behind the notice report (golden rules 5 and 12). Shifts are cancelled, assignments are cancelled, never removed | Full CRUD like the Phase 1 tables: simpler, but lets a bug erase evidence |
| `credential_rules` gets full CRUD | The office will edit which credentials a role needs (changes logged as events) | Read-only: blocks a Phase 5 settings screen |
| Foreign keys from the new tables have no ON DELETE action (a delete of a referenced worker, site or shift fails) | Deleting a worker must never silently delete or orphan their assignment history. Phase 8's GDPR delete will need an explicit anonymise-or-purge step (parked) | CASCADE (loses evidence) or SET NULL (a filled slot would look open) |
| One assignment row per slot *per holder*: a partial unique index allows only one "live" row per `(shift_id, slot)` (live = not cancelled). A cancellation keeps its row (with reason and notice hours) and a new open row reopens the slot | Keeps who cancelled and their notice hours on the row, and "first yes wins" still works: `UPDATE ... WHERE id = $slot AND worker_id IS NULL` | `unique (shift_id, slot)` from the old sketch: reopening a slot would mean wiping the cancelled worker off the row |
| A second partial unique index: one worker can't hold two live slots on the same shift | Stops a double-assign of the same person (golden rule 4) at the database level | Leave it to code only |
| CHECK constraints: open slot ⇔ no worker; confirmed/no-show/completed need `confirmed_at`; a cancelled row must have `cancelled_at`, a non-blank reason and `notice_hours` | Golden rule 12 (reason and notice hours per worker) enforced by the database, not just by code | Code-only checks |
| `notice_hours` is `numeric(8,2)` and may be negative (a cancel after the start) | Hours to two decimals is enough for the report; a late cancel must still be recorded | `integer` hours: too coarse for a 48 h threshold |
| `credential_rules` has a `sector` column (one of the four sectors), `role`, `required_types text[]`, unique per `(firm_id, role)` | "Per sector/role": a firm working in two sectors (rail and civils) keeps each pack's rules labelled; the rules engine looks up by role | Take the sector from `firms.sector`: breaks for multi-sector firms |
| `required_types` must be credential type codes (`^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$`, no nulls); roles in `shifts` and `credential_rules` must be `snake_case` | A typo (`sia_ds`, `Door Supervisor`) would silently never match and could let the rules skip a check | No format checks |
| `shifts` has `unique (firm_id, source, external_ref)` | The Sheets and CSV sync can upsert a sheet row without creating duplicates | Match on times and site: fragile |
| Offers are unique per `(shift_id, worker_id, wave)` | Makes the `offer-wave` job safe to retry (its idempotency key is `shift:wave`) while still allowing a later wave after a new dropout | Unique per `(shift_id, worker_id)`: blocks re-offering after a refill |
| Requests: `time_change` and `swap` must name a shift; `approved`/`declined` must have `resolved_at` and `resolved_by`; `open`/`escalated` must have neither | Every office decision is attributable | Code-only |
| The isolation test's "can't update or delete" check is split into one update check and one delete check, each keyed on its own privilege | Tables with UPDATE but no DELETE (the new ones) need it. Nothing is weakened: each old assertion still runs | Give the new tables DELETE just to fit the old test |
| `credential_types` (mentioned in `docs/rules-and-credentials.md`) is not in this task | Belongs to the "Credential packs seeded" task; decided there | Build it now |

**Built.** `src/lib/db/schema/roster.ts` (5 tables, 23 CHECK constraints, 8 composite foreign keys,
5 unique keys beyond the `(firm_id, id)` ones), migration
`drizzle/0004_phase2_roster.sql`, `TABLE_ACCESS` entries, fixtures in `tests/helpers/tenant-rows.ts`
(the rota rows point at a second "rota" worker and site, because their foreign keys have no ON
DELETE action and the isolation tests delete the first ones, rolled back), and
`tests/integration/roster.schema.test.ts` (39 tests). Local dev database rebuilt with
`npm run db:reset` (0004 was regenerated after the review).

**Guardrails review** (`guardrails-reviewer`): verdict FIX FIRST, one item. All fixed except where
noted:

- FIX FIRST F1: three unique keys (`assignments_one_live_per_slot`,
  `assignments_one_live_per_worker`, the offers wave key) didn't start with `firm_id`. Postgres
  checks unique indexes before foreign keys, so Firm A pointing a row at Firm B's shift got a
  duplicate-key error (slot filled) instead of a foreign-key error: a one-bit leak between firms.
  **Fixed**: `firm_id` leads all three (the offers key is now
  `offers_firm_id_shift_id_worker_id_wave_key`). New tests: each probe from another firm gets only
  `23503` (foreign key), next to a control in the owning firm that gets `23505`. New catalogue test
  in `rls.every-table`: every unique index on a firm table starts with `firm_id`, except the four
  random-token ones. It flagged the same pattern in Phase 1's `otp_codes_one_live_per_session`,
  also **fixed** (now `(firm_id, session_id)`) in the same migration.
- SHOULD FIX S1 (a missing credential rule could skip the licence check): **fixed in the docs**:
  `docs/rules-and-credentials.md` now says no rule for the role means not eligible (fail closed),
  with two new rows in the test table for the rules-engine task. A foreign key
  shifts→credential_rules was rejected: it would make a Sheets import fail on any new role.
- SHOULD FIX S2 (the first-yes-wins statement didn't check the shift is open): **fixed**: the
  documented statement (roster.ts comment, data-model.md) now joins `shifts` and requires
  `status = 'open'`; tested for draft, filled and cancelled. Parked: race-safe `offered → confirmed`
  and retiring open slots of a cancelled shift.
- NOTE, comma inside one type code (`{"SIA_DS,SIA_SG"}`) passed the check: **fixed** (cardinality
  comparison) and tested. Other notes (any-of credentials, `notice_hours` computed by the app,
  derived `filled` status, logging rule edits, one pack per role name) are documented or parked.
  The old "offered → accepted" wording in data-model.md is corrected.

**Verify, round 1:** NOT VERIFIED, 1 of 733 tests failed: `tenancy.current-firm` expected exactly
1 worker in a test firm. Root cause: the fixture now gives every test firm a second (rota) worker,
so the firm really has 2; the test hardcoded the old fixture's count. Fix: compare with the
superuser's count of that firm's workers and require the all-firms total to be higher (still
proves RLS filters, no longer tied to the fixture size).

**Verify, round 2:** `VERIFIED tree=75c75b23ec0d408d e2e=true` (733 tests, 10 e2e).

**claims-auditor (round 1), verbatim:**

```
VERDICT: DONE (for the specific task audited: "Schema: shifts, assignments, requests, offers, credential_rules (per sector/role)")

Step 1 check: `.claude/state/verified.json` = `{"ok":true,"tree":"75c75b23ec0d408d","e2e":true,"at":"2026-09-28T17:00:18Z"}`. `./.claude/hooks/tree-hash.sh` = `75c75b23ec0d408d` — matches. Proceeding.

Claims:
- `shifts` table (status, source, role, headcount, dedupe by external_ref per source, site FK, firm isolation) — PROVEN — code: /home/dylan/shiftdesk-starter/src/lib/db/schema/roster.ts:101-138; migration: /home/dylan/shiftdesk-starter/drizzle/0004_phase2_roster.sql; tests: tests/integration/roster.schema.test.ts:67-156 (`describe("shifts")`, 6 tests), all passing per .claude/state/test.log:284-290.
- `assignments` table (one row per slot, first-yes-wins conditional UPDATE, cancel evidence, one-live-per-slot/worker) — PROVEN — code: roster.ts:147-215; tests: roster.schema.test.ts:158-346 (9 tests incl. "first yes wins: the conditional update fills an open slot once, and a second taker changes nothing"), passing per test.log:291-298.
- `requests` table (time_change/swap/availability/general, resolution evidence) — PROVEN — code: roster.ts:219-275; tests: roster.schema.test.ts:348-450 (3 tests), passing per test.log:299-301.
- `offers` table (wave/channel, one-per-worker-per-wave, response timing) — PROVEN — code: roster.ts:278-324; tests: roster.schema.test.ts:452-510 (3 tests), passing per test.log:302-304.
- `credential_rules` per sector/role — PROVEN — code: roster.ts:63-99 (sector enum check, role format check, required_types array-format check, one rule per firm+role); tests: roster.schema.test.ts:512-575 (3 tests), passing per test.log:305-307.
- Tenant isolation / RLS wiring for all 5 new tables — PROVEN — src/lib/db/admin/access.ts:31-35 (`credential_rules: CRUD`, others `NO_DELETE`); tests/helpers/tenant-rows.ts:9-24 (`EXPECTED_TABLES` includes all 5); table-driven tests/integration/rls.every-table.test.ts pass for each (e.g. test.log lines for "table assignments/credential_rules/offers ... has row level security enabled and forced / exactly the tenant policy / grants exactly TABLE_ACCESS"). Cross-firm leak-proofing for unique keys explicitly tested: roster.schema.test.ts:581-623 ("unique keys never reveal another firm's rows").
- Full test run: 733/733 tests passed, 32/32 files, per .claude/state/test.log tail ("Test Files 32 passed (32)", "Tests 733 passed (733)").

Fakes found: none. No `.only`/`.skip`/`xdescribe` in roster.schema.test.ts (grep confirmed empty). No TODO/not-implemented in roster.ts. Constraints are exercised both as refusals (check/duplicate/foreign-key error codes) and as accepted controls, not just happy-path assertions.

Scope note (not a defect in this task, but relevant to the phase-level "Done when" given): this task is only the first bullet of Phase 2. The phase's own "Done when" line ("rules tests pass; a seeded Sheet syncs both ways; double-assign impossible under a race test") is NOT yet satisfied by what's on disk:
- No `RosterPlug` interface or adapters exist (`grep -rl RosterPlug src/` → no matches).
- No `rules.table.test.ts`, `assign.race.test.ts`, or `sheets.sync.test.ts` exist (docs/testing.md:29,31,36 name these; none found under tests/).
- The only "race"-flavoured coverage is a sequential double-take check inside roster.schema.test.ts:322-345, not the concurrent 10-caller race test docs/testing.md:29 specifies.
All of PLAN.md's Phase 2 checkboxes (lines 105-119) remain unticked `[ ]`, consistent with this.

To reach DONE for this schema task: nothing — it is proven by code and passing tests.
To reach DONE for the whole Phase 2 (if that's what's ultimately being closed): 1) build the `RosterPlug` interface + native/Sheets/CSV adapters, 2) build the rules engine and seed credential packs, 3) write and pass `rules.table.test.ts`, `assign.race.test.ts` (concurrent), `sheets.sync.test.ts`.
```

(The auditor's scope note matches the plan: the phase's "Done when" is met by later Phase 2 tasks.)

**Ticked** in `PLAN.md` after the DONE verdict. **Parked** (in `PLAN.md`): GDPR worker delete
vs. rota foreign keys; a retention-purge path; retiring open slots when a shift is cancelled or
shrunk; race-safe `offered → confirmed` and one pure `notice_hours` function; the derived `filled`
status; logging credential-rule edits; any-of credentials; zod check of `workers.roles` spelling;
the office_users DELETE grant (now unblocked).

**Hours:** 0.5 h (16:37 to 17:04 UTC). Phase 2 so far: 0.5 h of the 30-40 h estimate.

**Commit:** `5cdc003 Phase 2: Schema: shifts, assignments, requests, offers, credential_rules (per
sector/role)` on `build/overnight`. **Push:** succeeded (`b957b94..5cdc003`). **CI:** not checked
(`gh` isn't installed here); see the Actions tab on GitHub for the `build/overnight` run.

## 2026-09-28 17:07 UTC: Phase 2, "`RosterPlug` interface: `listStaff`, `getShifts`, `assign`, `markCancelled`, `canWrite`"

**Plan.** `src/lib/roster/plug.ts`: the `RosterPlug` interface, the shapes it returns
(`RosterStaff`, `RosterShift`), zod schemas every adapter uses to check data from its source at the
boundary, and result types for `assign` and `markCancelled`. `src/lib/roster/notice.ts`: one pure
`noticeHours()` function. A shared **contract suite** (`tests/helpers/roster-contract.ts`): named
checks every adapter must pass (native, Sheets and CSV run it in their own tasks), against a fixed
scenario each adapter seeds into its own source. It runs now against an in-memory reference
adapter (`tests/helpers/memory-roster-plug.ts`, a test double), plus "the contract can fail"
checks with deliberately broken variants (like `rls.mutation`). Unit tests for the schemas and
`noticeHours()`. `docs/architecture.md` updated.

**Decisions (would normally wait for Dylan's OK):**

| Decision | Why | Alternative considered |
|---|---|---|
| Reads return records keyed by `ref`, the source's own key (our worker/shift id for native, the sheet or CSV row key otherwise); writes take our ids (`assign(shiftId, workerId)`, as in architecture.md) | The sync job upserts by `(source, external_ref)`; the portal only knows our ids. Each adapter maps between them | Refs everywhere (the portal would need to know sheet keys) or ids everywhere (a sheet row has no id until synced) |
| `markCancelled(shiftId, workerId, { reason, by: "worker" \| "firm" })` | Golden rule 12: a firm cancel is logged like a worker cancel, and the database needs `cancelled_worker` vs `cancelled_firm`. A blank reason is refused | `reason` only (can't tell who cancelled) |
| Results are tagged unions: assign → `assigned` / `filled` / `already_assigned` / `not_open` / `not_found` / `needs_approval`; cancel → `cancelled` (with `noticeHours`) / `not_assigned` / `not_found` / `needs_approval` | Each outcome needs different copy ("Just filled", etc.); matches the auth code's result style | Throwing errors for normal outcomes |
| `canWrite: false` means `assign`/`markCancelled` change nothing and return `needs_approval` | architecture.md: "prepare the change, office taps approve". The approve queue itself comes later | Throwing on write |
| The plug doesn't check eligibility | "AI reads, code decides" stays in one place: the rules engine, called by the take-shift service before `assign` | Rules inside every adapter |
| `getShifts(from, to)` returns shifts *starting* in `[from, to)`, every status (draft and cancelled included), with who holds each slot | The sync job mirrors the whole source; the portal filters. A window must end after it starts | Open shifts only |
| `noticeHours(startsAt, cancelledAt)`: hours to 2 decimals, rounded half away from zero, negative after the start, never `-0` | Matches `assignments.notice_hours numeric(8,2)` exactly; one function for every adapter (parked from the schema task) | Each adapter computing its own |
| `ROLE_PATTERN` is exported from the schema and used by both the database CHECK and the zod schema | One spelling rule by construction, not by a test that keeps two copies in step | Two copies |
| The in-memory adapter lives in `tests/helpers`, not `src` | It is a test double that proves the contract suite; no firm uses it | A "memory" source in the app |

**Built.** `src/lib/roster/plug.ts` (interface, boundary schemas, result types, and the decisions
above written into its header), `src/lib/roster/notice.ts`, `ROLE_PATTERN` and `WORKER_STATUSES`
shared from the schema (no migration change: drift check clean),
`tests/helpers/roster-contract.ts` (21 named checks), `tests/helpers/memory-roster-plug.ts` (13
faults), `tests/unit/roster.contract.test.ts` and `tests/unit/roster.plug.test.ts`.

**Guardrails review** (`guardrails-reviewer`): verdict FIX FIRST, one item.

- FIX FIRST 1: the "office cancellation is recorded the same way (golden rule 12)" check could
  never fail: nothing read back what an adapter stored, so an adapter that saved every cancel as
  the worker's, or dropped the reason, would pass. **Fixed**: the fixture now has
  `cancellations()` (for native: the assignments row's status, reason and notice hours); both
  cancel checks assert who, why and the notice hours; new `ignore_by` and `drop_reason` faults
  prove the checks catch it.
- SHOULD FIX 2 (notice counted from when the call runs): **fixed**: `cancel.at` (when the person
  asked) is required, notice counts from it, and a `cancel.at` after the plug's clock is refused.
  Two new checks and two faults (`notice_from_clock`, `future_at_ok`). Parked: saving the pending
  change on `needs_approval`.
- SHOULD FIX 3 (who owns the transaction and the event row): **decided and written into
  plug.ts**: adapters that write our tables are built on the caller's `withFirm` transaction; the
  caller writes the `events` row from the result in the same transaction. The "at once" check is
  renamed to say what it proves (one plug, calls in flight); the cross-connection race stays with
  `assign.race`.
- SHOULD FIX 4 (eligibility pass and worker lock): **parked** for the rules engine and atomic
  assign tasks (they don't exist yet; a branded type now would have no creator).
- SHOULD FIX 5 (no cross-firm check in the contract): **fixed**: the harness must supply two
  firms; a new check requires the other firm's rows to be unlisted, `not_found` by id and
  unchanged, with a `cross_firm` fault proving it can fail.
- Notes: worker statuses now one shared list (`WORKER_STATUSES`); the pasted `ROLE_PATTERN`
  refuses `'` or `\`; the real venue name in test data replaced by the seed's "Acme Demo Arena";
  plug.ts now says the plug assigns inactive workers or past shifts if asked (the rules engine
  must stop that) and that staff views must leave out drafts. Not changed: the memory double
  reports `source: "native"` (harmless), and `rosterShiftSchema` doesn't force "filled" to mean
  every slot held (a derived status that may lag; the read must not fail on it).

**Verify:** `VERIFIED tree=20703b1cd636b217 e2e=true` (802 tests, 10 e2e), first run.

VERDICT: DONE

Task audited: PLAN.md Phase 2 bullet — "`RosterPlug` interface: `listStaff`, `getShifts`, `assign`, `markCancelled`, `canWrite`" (still unchecked `[ ]` in PLAN.md at the time of this audit — auditor does not tick it).

Step 1 gate: `.claude/state/verified.json` → `{"ok":true,"tree":"20703b1cd636b217","e2e":true,...}`. `./.claude/hooks/tree-hash.sh` → `20703b1cd636b217`. Match, so proceeding.

Claims:
- Interface defines all 5 members with correct signatures — PROVEN — `src/lib/db/schema/roster.ts:32` (ROLE_PATTERN, SHIFT_SOURCES, SHIFT_STATUSES) and `src/lib/roster/plug.ts:114-129` declare `RosterPlug { source, canWrite, listStaff(), getShifts(from,to), assign(shiftId,workerId), markCancelled(shiftId,workerId,cancel) }` exactly matching the bullet, plus `AssignResult`/`CancelResult` result-type unions (lines 93-112) and zod schemas `rosterStaffSchema`/`rosterShiftSchema`/`shiftWindowSchema`/`cancelInputSchema` (lines 34-91).
- Schema/type validation is real, not a stub — PROVEN — `tests/unit/roster.plug.test.ts:37-135` exercises `rosterStaffSchema`, `rosterShiftSchema`, `shiftWindowSchema`, `cancelInputSchema` with accept/reject cases, plus `ROLE_PATTERN` cross-checked against live Postgres CHECK constraints (`roster.ts:36`, test lines 122-135) so zod and DB agree. `noticeHours()` (`src/lib/roster/notice.ts:7-11`) covers rounding, DST, negative notice (test lines 137-170).
- A general contract suite exists so every adapter (native/Sheets/CSV) is checked identically — PROVEN — `tests/helpers/roster-contract.ts` defines 20 `ContractCheck`s covering listStaff, getShifts (window, copies), assign (first-yes-wins, concurrent race, multi-slot, already_assigned, not_open, not_found), markCancelled (store evidence, notice from `cancel.at` not clock, blank reason/future `at` rejected, not_assigned), read-only mode, and cross-firm isolation.
- Contract suite is actually run and is not a fake — PROVEN — `tests/unit/roster.contract.test.ts` runs `describeRosterContract()` against a full in-memory reference adapter (`tests/helpers/memory-roster-plug.ts`), and separately proves every check can fail via 15 deliberately-broken "fault" variants (`double_assign`, `ignore_window`, `zero_notice`, `cross_firm`, etc., lines 59-82) — this rules out vacuous/tautological tests.
- No fakes/skips — PROVEN — `grep` for `.skip`, `.only`, `TODO`, `not implemented` across `src/lib/roster/`, `tests/helpers/{roster-contract,memory-roster-plug}.ts`, `tests/unit/roster.{contract,plug}.test.ts` returned nothing.
- Tests actually pass in the logged run for the current tree — PROVEN — `.claude/state/test.log:572-608` and `:717-` show every `roster.contract.test.ts` and `roster.plug.test.ts` test with `✓`, and the run summary at the end of the log reads "Test Files 34 passed (34) / Tests 802 passed (802)". `test.log` mtime (Sep 28 18:26) postdates the `verified.json` timestamp write and matches the current tree hash.
- Docs updated consistently — PROVEN — `docs/architecture.md:115-156` documents the same interface shape, result unions, contract-suite guarantees and adapter table; matches `src/lib/roster/plug.ts` verbatim in shape.

Fakes found: none.

Scope note: only the interface bullet was in scope here. The next unchecked bullets (native adapter, Sheets adapter, rules engine, race test, `sheets.sync`) are correctly still unchecked in PLAN.md and were not claimed as done — the Phase 2 "Done when" (rules tests pass, Sheet syncs both ways, race-proof double-assign) is a phase-level bar for later tasks, not this one; the interface task doesn't yet require an adapter, and none was found or claimed.

To reach DONE: nothing further needed for this specific bullet.
```

(Count check: the contract has 21 checks, `grep -c '^    name: '`; the auditor's "20" is a
miscount. "15 fault variants" is the 15 fault cases, covering 13 kinds of fault.)

**Ticked** in `PLAN.md` after the DONE verdict. **Parked** (in `PLAN.md`): an `EligibilityPass`
for `assign` plus a worker lock (rules engine / atomic assign tasks); saving pending changes on
`needs_approval` before any read-only source goes live.

**Hours:** 0.4 h (17:07 to 17:29 UTC). Phase 2 so far: 0.9 h of the 30-40 h estimate.
